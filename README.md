# SpotifyRPC Extras
This is not necessary to run the SpotifyRPC python app, this is just an extension for it.  
This takes the data from my [SpotifyRPC Server](https://github.com/slingexe/SpotifyRPC) and displays it in a web format  

This uses cloudflared to host the website without port forwarding.



# ~~SpotifyRPC Listen Along~~
After creating all of this with listen along in mind, I found out about the absurd requirements for extended quota mode, basically killing this...  
Lets hope spotify reverts this...
